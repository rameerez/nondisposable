# üóëÔ∏è `nondisposable` - Block disposable email addresses from signing up to your Rails app

`nondisposable` is a Ruby gem for Rails apps that checks and prevents users from signing up with disposable email addresses. The list of disposable emails is updated daily.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nondisposable'
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

After installing the gem, run the installation generator:

```bash
rails generate nondisposable:install
```

This will create the necessary migration file, initializer, and a job for scheduled updates. Run the migration:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

Finally, populate the initial list of disposable domains:

```ruby
Nondisposable::DomainListUpdater.update
```

## Usage

To use `nondisposable` in your models, add the following validation:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates_nondisposable_email_of :email
end
```

You can also add a custom error message:
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  validates_nondisposable_email_of :email, message: "is from a disposable email provider"
end
```

### Configuration

You can customize the gem's behavior by creating an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/nondisposable.rb

Nondisposable.configure do |config|
  config.error_message = "is not allowed. Please use a non-disposable email address."
  config.additional_domains = ['custom-disposable-domain.com']
  config.excluded_domains = ['false-positive-domain.com']
end
```

### Direct Check

You can also check if an email is disposable directly:

```ruby
Nondisposable.disposable?('user@example.com') # => false
Nondisposable.disposable?('user@disposable-email.com') # => true
```

## Updating disposable domains

To manually update the list of disposable domains, run:

```ruby
Nondisposable::DomainListUpdater.update
```

It's important you keep your disposable domain list up to date. `nondisposable` provides you with an Active Job (`DisposableEmailDomainListUpdateJob`) you can use to schedule daily updates. How you do that, exactly, depends on the queueing system you're using.

If you're using `solid_queue` (the Rails 8 default), you can easily add it to your schedule in the `config/recurring.yml` file like this:
```yaml
production:
  refresh_disposable_domains:
    class: DisposableEmailDomainListUpdateJob
    queue: default
    schedule: every day at 3am US/Pacific
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
